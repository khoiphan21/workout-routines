# Dumbbell Row (1-arm bench supported)

⚙️ Technique:

- Set up with 1 knee and the same-side hand on the bench; other foot on the floor, hip-width.
- Keep spine neutral and hips/shoulders square; brace ribs down.
- Row toward the lower ribs or hip; pause 1–2s at the top; lower 2–3s.
- Perform sets per side. Alternate sides each set or complete all sets on one side, then switch.

🎯 Work prescription:

- 3x10 per side
- Superset pairing: alternate with Straight Arm Band Pulldown; rest 60s between exercises

📈 5 progression levels:

- Level 1: 3x12 light DB with 1s squeeze.
- Level 2: 3x10 moderate DB with 2s lowering.
- Level 3: 3x10 heavier DB with 2s squeeze.
- Level 4: 3x8 heavier DB with 3s lowering and 1s pause.
- Level 5: 3x8 heavier DB keeping hips and shoulders square.

✅ Progress when:

- No torso rotation, shoulder stays packed, and the last 2 reps are controlled on both sides.

🪜 Scaling tools:

- Shorten range slightly until control is perfect, then increase depth.
- Adjust bench height or stance to keep spine neutral.
- Use lifting straps only if grip limits back effort; do not allow torso twist to create momentum.
