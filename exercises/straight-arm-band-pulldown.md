# Straight Arm Band Pulldown

⚙️ Technique:

- Slight hip hinge, ribs down, long arms with a soft elbow. Pull to the thighs without using the lower back.

🎯 Work prescription:

- 3x15
- Superset pairing: alternate with Dumbbell Row (1-arm bench supported); rest 60s between exercises

📈 5 progression levels:

- Level 1: 3x15 light band with 2s squeeze near the hips.
- Level 2: 3x15 medium band with 2s squeeze.
- Level 3: 3x15 step further from the anchor to increase tension.
- Level 4: 3x12 with 3s lowering.
