# Warm-up

🎯 Purpose of the day:

- Strength focused pull session: power first, then calisthenics skill strength, then hypertrophy.
- Quality before quantity. Progress only when technique is consistent.

🔗 Routine structure and supersets:

- Do not superset the power movement.
- Superset pairs:
- Front Lever Hold ↔ Rings Hamstring Curl
- Dumbbell Row (1-arm bench supported) ↔ Straight Arm Band Pulldown
- Band Face Pull ↔ Dumbbell Curl
- Rest 60s between exercises when alternating in each superset.

🔥 Intensity guidance:

- Power triples: work at ~85–90% of today’s best triple with 1 rep in reserve on the first 2 work sets.
- Hypertrophy sets: aim for RPE 8–9, which is 1–2 reps in reserve.
- Timed holds: choose a level that allows strong positions for the whole set time with 1–2 seconds in reserve.

🤝 Shared scaling for partners:

- Choose assistance or load so the final 2 reps (or final seconds) are challenging with clean technique.
- Match range of motion and tempo first, then adjust load, band tension, or leverage.

🛡️ General safety:

- Keep shoulders depressed and retracted on all pulling movements.
- Keep ribs down on straight arm work to avoid lower back extension.
- Stop a set if technique breaks down.

🚀 General warm up:

- Band Pull-Aparts — 1x10
- Band Dislocates — 1x10
- Banded Face Pulls — 1x10
- Banded Overhead Press — 1x10
- Banded Squats — 1x10
- Banded Good Mornings — 1x10

📈 Power lift ramp sets for weighted pull ups:

- Warm up set 1: bodyweight 1x6.
- Warm up set 2: +5–10 kg 1x3.
- Warm up set 3: ~80% of work weight 1x2.
- Warm up set 4: ~90% of work weight 1x1.
- Then perform work sets 3x3 with 3–4 min rest.

🔄 If you attempt a progression and cannot meet the target today (applies to all exercises):

**_Strength prescriptions (for example 3x3 or 4x5)_**

- If you miss early (only set 1 completes): reduce load by 2.5–5 kg or increase assistance and finish the remaining sets at the easier level with perfect form.
- If you miss only the final set: rest an extra 60–90s and try again. If still short, reduce load 2.5–5 kg (or add a small band) and complete the set.
- If bar speed is very slow or form breaks: drop 5–10% load immediately and complete quality sets.
- You may use clusters to complete a set without grinding: split a triple as 2+1 with 20–30s between mini-sets (counts as 1 set).
- Consider 1 back-off set at the end: reduce 5–10% and perform 1x3–5 with crisp form.

**_Hypertrophy rep ranges (for example 3x12–15)_**

- If you cannot hit the bottom of the range on later sets, keep the same weight and stop 1 rep short of form breakdown, then increase rest by 15–30s next time.
- If you are under the bottom of the range by >2 reps across the session, reduce load next time by 2.5–5% and rebuild.

**_Timed holds (for example 4x8–12s)_**

- If you cannot hold the target seconds with clean position, shorten each set to the lowest end of the range or regress leverage (for example advanced tuck → tuck).
- If you are short by >2–3s on multiple sets, repeat the same level next time or regress leverage slightly.

🗓️ Next session rules after a miss:

- If you were within 1 rep (or 2–5s on holds) of the total target across the session, repeat the same load/level next time.
- If you were short by more than that, reduce next session by 2.5–5 kg (or easier leverage/band) to secure clean volume, then climb again.
- If you fail the same target 2 sessions in a row, deload 7–10% (or easier leverage and slightly longer rests) for 1 session, then reattempt.
