# Dumbbell Curl (Biceps Curl)

⚙️ Technique:

- Stand tall with feet hip-width, slight knee bend, ribs down, and shoulders set back and down.
- Hold 1 DB in each hand; curl while supinating to palms-up at the top.
- Keep elbows close to torso; avoid swinging or leaning back.
- Pause 1–2s at the top; lower 2–3s to full elbow extension.

🎯 Work prescription:

- 3x10
- Superset pairing: alternate with Band Face Pull; rest 60s between exercises

📈 5 progression levels:

- Level 1: 3x12 light DBs with 1s squeeze.
- Level 2: 3x10 moderate DBs with 2s lowering.
- Level 3: 3x10 heavier DBs with strict form.
- Level 4: 3x8 with 2s pause at full stretch before each rep.
- Level 5: Keep 3x10; on the final set perform a mechanical drop set (strict supinated to near failure, then immediate hammer curls).

✅ Progress when:

- Elbows stay in place, wrists fully supinate at the top, no torso sway, and the last 2 reps are controlled through full range of motion.

🪜 Scaling tools:

- Stand with back lightly against a wall to prevent leaning and swinging.
- Use alternating curls if both-arm curls cause torso sway, then progress back to simultaneous curls.
- Reduce load and slow the eccentric if range of motion shortens or shoulders roll forward.
