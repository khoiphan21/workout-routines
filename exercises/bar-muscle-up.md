# Bar Muscle Up

⚙️ Technique:

- Overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder width.
- Pull explosively to sternum or upper chest without leg kick.
- Fast wrist turnover as the bar reaches chest height, then press through to straight bar dip lockout.
- Keep ribs down; avoid “chicken wing” (one elbow over first). Aim for both elbows together over the bar.

🎯 Work prescription:

- Warm up 1x3 at an easier variation (for example chest-to-bar pull or light band assist)
- Then 3x3
- Rest 2 min between sets

📈 5 progression levels (all 3x3 unless noted):

- Level 1: 3x3 chest-to-bar pull-ups (sternum height).
- Level 2: 3x3 explosive chest-over-bar pulls.
- Level 3: 3x3 band-assisted bar muscle ups.
- Level 4: 3x6s controlled negatives from the top.
- Level 5: 3x3 strict bar muscle ups.

✅ Progress when:

- Both elbows clear together, no kip, smooth turnover, and full lockout each rep.

🪜 Scaling tools:

- Adjust band thickness or use a slightly higher box for assisted starts, then remove assistance gradually.
- Narrow grip slightly if elbows flare; think “pull to ribs, then push over”.
- Use isometric holds at the top of pull (bar at chest) for 3–5s to improve turnover confidence.
