# General Notes and Warm-up

🎯 Program purpose:

- Strength first (heavy triples).
- Calisthenics skill strength second (holds and technical pulls).
- Hypertrophy last (pump and control).
- Quality before quantity. Progress only when technique is consistent.

🔗 Superset pairs (rest 60s between exercises):

- **Push A:**
  - Decline Ring Push-up ↔ Ring Flye
  - Band Lateral Raise ↔ Band Triceps Pressdown
- **Pull A:**
  - Front Lever Hold ↔ Rings Hamstring Curl
  - Feet-Elevated Inverted Row ↔ Straight-Arm Band Pulldown
- **Push B:**
  - Pike Push-up ↔ Ring Push-Up
  - Band Lateral Raise ↔ Overhead Band Triceps Extension
- **Pull B:**
  - Back Lever Tuck Hold ↔ Nordic Curl
  - Wide-Grip Inverted Row ↔ Band High-to-Low Row

🔥 Intensity guidance:

- **Power triples:** work at ~85–90% of today’s best triple with 1 rep in reserve on the first 2 work sets.
- **Hypertrophy sets:** aim for RPE 8–9, which is 1–2 reps in reserve.
- **Timed holds:** choose a level that allows strong positions for the whole set time with 1–2 seconds in reserve.

🤝 Shared scaling for partners:

- Choose assistance or load so the final 2 reps (or final seconds) are challenging with clean technique.
- Match range of motion and tempo first, then adjust load, band tension, or leverage.

🛡️ General safety:

- Keep shoulders depressed and retracted on all pulling movements.
- On presses, keep shoulders packed and avoid excessive flare.
- Keep ribs down on straight arm and core work to avoid lower back extension.
- Stop a set if technique breaks down.

🚀 General warm up (every day):

- Band Pull-Aparts — 1x10
- Band Dislocates — 1x10
- Banded Scapular Protraction — 1x10
- Banded Shoulder External Rotation — 1x10
- Banded One-Arm Triceps Overhead Press — 1x10 per side
- Banded RDLs — 1x10
- Banded Bent-Over Rows — 1x10
- Banded Squat to Press — 1x10
- Quadruped Thoracic Rotation — 1x10 per side

📈 Power lift ramp-up sets (e.g. Weighted Pull-ups/Dips):

- Warm up set 1: Bodyweight 1x6.
- Warm up set 2: Light weight or band assistance 1x3.
- Warm up set 3: ~80% of work weight 1x2.
- Warm up set 4: ~90% of work weight 1x1.
- Then perform work sets (e.g., 3x3) with 3–4 min rest.

🔄 If you attempt a progression and cannot meet the target today (applies to all exercises):

**_Strength prescriptions (for example 3x3 or 4x5)_**

- If you miss early (only set 1 completes): reduce load by 2.5–5 kg or increase assistance and finish the remaining sets at the easier level with perfect form.
- If you miss only the final set: rest an extra 60–90s and try again. If still short, reduce load 2.5–5 kg (or add a small band) and complete the set.
- If bar speed is very slow or form breaks: drop 5–10% load immediately and complete quality sets.
- You may use clusters to complete a set without grinding: split a triple as 2+1 with 20–30s between mini-sets (counts as 1 set).
- Consider 1 back-off set at the end: reduce 5–10% and perform 1x3–5 with crisp form.

**_Hypertrophy rep ranges (for example 3x10 or 3x12)_**

- If you cannot hit the target on later sets, keep the same weight and stop 1 rep short of form breakdown, then increase rest by 15–30s next time.
- If you are under the target by >2 reps across the session, reduce load next time by 2.5–5% and rebuild.

**_Timed holds (for example 3x12s)_**

- If you cannot hold the target seconds with clean position, shorten each set to your minimum for the day or regress leverage (for example advanced tuck → tuck).
- If you are short by >2–3s on multiple sets, repeat the same level next time or regress leverage slightly.

🗓️ Next session rules after a miss:

- If you were within 1 rep (or 2–5s on holds) of the total target across the session, repeat the same load/level next time.
- If you were short by more than that, reduce next session by 2.5–5 kg (or easier leverage/band) to secure clean volume, then climb again.
- If you fail the same target 2 sessions in a row, deload 7–10% (or easier leverage and slightly longer rests) for 1 session, then reattempt.
