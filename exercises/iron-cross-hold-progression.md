# Iron Cross Hold Progression

⚙️ Technique:

- Start in a ring support position with arms straight and shoulders depressed.
- Keep your body hollow and core engaged; avoid arching your back.
- Slowly lower your arms out to the sides, maintaining straight elbows.
- Go only as low as you can control without pain. The goal is a horizontal line with the body for a full Iron Cross.

🎯 Work prescription:

- 3x10 s holds at your current progression level.
- Rest 2-3 minutes between sets.

📈 5 progression levels:

- Level 1: 3x10s Ring Support Hold with arms straight down.
- Level 2: 3x10s hold with arms flared out to a 15-degree angle.
- Level 3: 3x10s hold with arms flared out to a 30-degree angle.
- Level 4: 3x10s hold with arms flared out to a 45-degree angle (halfway to full cross).
- Level 5: 3x10s Band-Supported Iron Cross (band under hips/thighs for assistance).

✅ Progress when:

- You can complete all prescribed holds at a given angle without shoulder elevation or bending your arms.

🪜 Scaling tools:

- Adjust band tension for the Level 5 progression. Use a thicker band for more support.
- Reduce hold times if you cannot maintain the position with good form.
- Focus on scapular depression (shoulders down) at all times.
