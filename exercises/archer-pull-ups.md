# Archer or Typewriter Pull-Ups

⚙️ Technique:

- Keep hips square and do not twist. Pull toward one hand while the other arm stays long, then switch sides under control.

🎯 Work prescription:

- 3x4 per side (or 3x4 total shifts for typewriter)
- Rest 2 min between sets (not a superset)

📈 5 progression levels:

- Level 1: 3x10 per side archer ring rows with feet forward.
- Level 2: 3x6 per side archer pull-ups with light band assist.
- Level 3: 3x4 per side archer pull-ups bodyweight only.
- Level 4: 3x4 total shifts typewriter pull-ups.
- Level 5: 3x4 per side archer pull-ups with added load or 3s lowering.

✅ Progress when:

- You complete all prescribed reps per side without hip rotation or shoulder elevation.

🪜 Scaling tools:

- Use a light band or reduce range until control is consistent, then increase range or load.
