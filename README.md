# Pull–Push Program (Home Gym)

A complete, machine-friendly 5-day split you can run in Power, Tempo, and Volume weeks using the same exercises. Only the progression level, reps/sets, and (for Tempo) tempo change.

## Why this program

- Strength first (heavy triples).
- Calisthenics skill strength second (holds and technical pulls).
- Hypertrophy last (pump and control).
- Non-competing supersets to save time.
- Single, fixed prescriptions (e.g., 3x10) so no thinking mid-set.
- Built for partners training together at different levels.

## Equipment

- Pull-up bar, weight plates, weight belt.
- Rings with adjustable straps.
- Resistance bands of various tensions.
- Low bars (for dips and rows).

## Weekly structure

5 days per week:

- Day 1: Push A
- Day 2: Pull A
- Day 3: Conditioning
- Day 4: Push B
- Day 5: Pull B

## Week types (rotate; keep the exact exercises)

- **Power Week:** strength emphasis, low reps, long rests.
- **Tempo Week:** position control with slow eccentrics/pauses.
- **Volume Week:** more total work at lower intensity.

## Global rules

- **General warm-up (every day):**
  - Band Pull-Aparts — 1x10
  - Band Dislocates — 1x10
  - Banded Scapular Protraction — 1x10
  - Banded Shoulder External Rotation — 1x10
  - Banded One-Arm Triceps Overhead Press — 1x10 per side
  - Banded RDLs — 1x10
  - Banded Bent-Over Rows — 1x10
  - Banded Squat to Press — 1x10
  - Quadruped Thoracic Rotation — 1x10 per side
- **Power triples:** ~85–90% of the day’s triple; 1 rep in reserve on the first 2 sets.
- **Hypertrophy:** RPE 8–9 (1–2 reps in reserve).
- **Holds:** pick a level that allows full target time with clean positions plus 1–2 s in reserve.
- **Supersets:** alternate movements; rest 60 s between the paired exercises. Do not superset the power triple.

### Progression failure rule (applies to all exercises)

#### Strength (e.g., 3x3 or 4x5)

- Miss early (only set 1 completes): reduce load 2.5–5 kg or increase assistance; finish the day clean.
- Miss only final set: rest +60–90 s and retry; if still short, reduce 2.5–5 kg and complete.
- Form breaks or bar speed crawls: drop 5–10% immediately and finish quality work.
- Clusters allowed to finish without grinding (e.g., 2+1 with 20–30 s intra-set).
- Optional back-off: −5–10% for 1x3–5 crisp.

#### Hypertrophy (e.g., 3x12 or 3x10)

- If later sets miss target: keep load, stop 1 rep shy of form breakdown; next time add 15–30 s rest.
- If >2 reps under target across the session: reduce load 2.5–5% next time and rebuild.

#### Timed holds (e.g., 3x12 s)

- If you cannot hit the time clean: shorten to minimum for the day or regress leverage one step.
- If short by >2–3 s on multiple sets: repeat same level next time or regress slightly.

### Next session after a miss

- Within 1 rep of total (or 2–5 s on holds): repeat same load/level.
- Missed by more: reduce next session by 2.5–5 kg (or easier leverage/band), secure volume, then climb.
- Two misses in a row: deload 7–10% (or easier leverage and slightly longer rests) for one session, then reattempt.
